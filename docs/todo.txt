- clean up code in TcContext, Box ( refactor runtime errors to eithers)
- move generic Utils methods to scutsMcore module
- allow tc resolver to resolve passed type class instances (IntSumMonoid f.e. with 1.tc(IntSumMonoid)
- clean up type class instances
- add context class that should provide everything with one import
- how to handle special boxing functions (for kleisli, either, tuples)
- resolved instances of type classes should be reused through static methods of generated classes

- auto create type classes for record types ( needs type classes for all constructor arguments as dependencies )
- auto create type classes for enums ( needs type classes for all fields as dependencies )
